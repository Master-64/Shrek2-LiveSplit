# Shrek 2 Auto Splitter for LiveSplit on PC.
This Repository is a LiveSplit' Auto Splitter for Shrek 2 on PC.

## Features
- Auto splitting at Tutorial/Swamp, Wheel Stealers, Spooky Forest, Puss in Boots Boss Fight, Factory, Bandits Forest, Knight boss (Seperately on Donkey, Puss in Boots and Shrek), Castle and Fairy Godmother.
- Supports auto splitting of multiple outcomes. For example:
  - For the split 'Spooky Forest' it can split in 2 ways. Either by defeating the Puss in Boots Boss directly, or by skipping it entirely through glitching.
  - (Please let me know if there is other places which has multiple ways to finish a segment)

## How to install
At the moment until the Auto Splitter have been submitted and approved for the LiveSplit auto- installer, you have to do a few steps to get going:

1. Download the <a href="https://github.com/kevinjpetersen/Shrek2-LiveSplit/raw/master/Shrek2-LiveSplit/Components/Shrek2-LiveSplit.dll">Shrek2-LiveSplit.dll</a> file.
2. Place the file in the folder "Components" in your main LiveSplit folder
3. Open LiveSplit and right-click on the application, then select "Edit Layout"
4. On the new window that just appeared, click the (plus) "+"- sign at the top left of the window
5. Then select the category "Control", and then "Shrek 2 Improved"
6. Double-click on the newly added Control in the list, here you can enable/disable the splits you want
7. Last but not least, ensure that your current activated Auto Splitter for Shrek 2 is Deactivated (If you have one)

## Future Plans
- I'm working on making it possible to customize automated splits however you want, based on when cutscenes triggers. You will be able to do this through an interface in the LiveSplit Control Settings for the Component.
