# Shrek 2 Auto Splitter for LiveSplit on PC.
This Repository is a LiveSplit' Auto Splitter for Shrek 2 on PC.

## Features
- Auto splitting at Tutorial/Swamp, Wheel Stealers, Spooky Forest, Puss in Boots Boss Fight, Factory, Bandits Forest, Knight boss (Seperately on Donkey, Puss in Boots and Shrek), Castle and Fairy Godmother.
- Supports auto splitting of multiple outcomes. For example:
  - For the split 'Spooky Forest' it can split in 2 ways. Either by defeating the Puss in Boots Boss directly, or by skipping it entirely through glitching.
  - (Please let me know if there is other places which has multiple ways to finish a segment)

## How to install
1. Open up LiveSplit, go into **Edit Splits**
2. Change the **Game Name** to "Shrek 2"
3. Then press the **Activate** button
4. Now it's activated and ready for use! If you need to customize it, you can click on the **Settings** button

## Change log
#### Version 1.0.1
- Fixed auto splitting of Knight boss with Donkey so that it splits if you skip the fight OR if you do the fight
#### Version 1.0.0
- Intial release

## Future Plans
- I'm working on making it possible to customize automated splits however you want, based on when cutscenes triggers. You will be able to do this through an interface in the LiveSplit Control Settings for the Component.
