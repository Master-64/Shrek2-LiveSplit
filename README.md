# So, what's different about this when compared to the classic auto-splitter?
- A working load remover that consistently works more often than the older one
- Reduced possibility of errors
- Split times are based on levels loading rather than cutscenes (except the final cutscene)
- Much cleaner code than Dalet's original auto-splitter everyone remembers

# Features
- Automatic splitting after each level
- Automatic load removal during level transitions
- If doing a marathon run, automatic timer pause until another map is opened (to start the next part of the run)
